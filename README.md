### Configuration

Before making requests, you must configure the gem with your key

```ruby
Typeform.configure do |config|
  config.typeform_token = "YOUR PERSONAL TOKEN"
  config.timeout = 10
  config.debug = false
end
```

### API
```ruby
* Typeform::Api::Form.retrieve_forms
* Typeform::Api::Form.retrieve_form(form_id)
* Typeform::Api::Response.retrieve_responses(form_id)
```
